# Technical Product Report

### Summary
During this implementation phase, we decided to change our final goal. Initially, we wanted to write an extension that can retrieve all Canvas assignments due and then take those data points and convert them into  Google Calendar tasks. As a team we noticed there is value in being able to see what is due on canvas at a click of a button, this saves the user the time of navigating over to Canvas. We believe our extension can provide value to students by being able to quickly make sure that you haven't missed something important. Therefore we have decided that for our final goal we want to be able to retrieve all assignments, tests, and quizzes coming up and list them for the user in a pop-up window. We also want to make the list interactive, with features such as writing a quick note next to an assignment, removing an item from the list, adding an item to the list and implementing animations for all these actions.

### What was built?
During this phase, we focused on the retrieval of assignments from the Canvas API and our extension pop-up implementation. A big milestone for us was to successfully retrieve all upcoming assignments and list them in a pop-up for the user. The way our extension currently works is when our icon is clicked on a pop-up window appears with two text boxes and a button. The first text box is asking what school the student goes to and the second text box is asking for an authorization token. After both text boxes are filled the user can click on the submit button which fetches all assignments due and lists them for the user in the pop-up window.

### Challanges
The first challenge we ran into was figuring out how to interact with the Canvas API, at first we found an npm package that assisted with that but quickly realized there were some challenges with importing packages on our extension javascript scripts. So instead we opted with interacting with the Canvas API directly using the javascript fetch function.

The next challenge we encountered was figuring out how to get authenticated for fetch requests to the Canvas servers. We found we need a "token" which is a unique string associated with a student's account. There are two ways to get the token, the first way is by the user generating the token manually by doing a series of steps on their Canvas profile. The second way is using Auth 2.0 which is "a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user",  where essentially a new window opens and the user is prompted to log in with their credentials and the authorization token is received and stored in the user's browser session storage.  Because we are trying to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) and Auth 2.0 requires a little bit more time to implement we decided Auth 2.0 can be a feature to be implemented in a future sprint.  Therefore, we opted to have the user copy and paste their token into our extension and then we save the token to their browser's local storage, so as long the user does not clear their cache they would only have to do that once.

### Reflection
As a team our progress has moved along pretty well, we have taken one challenge at a time and collaborated on finding solutions. An improvement we can perhaps make is documenting our work a little more such as adding more comments and writing more descriptive messages in our commits. Overall as a team, we are content with how our project is coming together and we are very excited to demo what we have so far.
